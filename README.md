A simple holder for a 15" MacBook Pro, made in TinkerCad with two half-spheres and a rectangular solid.

I initially made this at exactly the width of the MacBook Pro 17mm, but wound up reducing it to 15.5mm to avoid wobble. For the new thinner chassis in 2018 MBP (Got thinner in touchbar > 2016 I think). Reduced down to 14.8mm now.

I've also just developed (August 19, 2021) an [openscad version](macbookproholder.scad) you can adapt to any device:
